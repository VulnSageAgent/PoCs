# CVE-2025-57320

## Type
CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')

## Description
A vulnerability exists in the json-schema-editor-visual package versions prior to 2.0.0, where improper handling of property path validation in utility functions allows attackers to manipulate or delete properties within the prototype chain of JavaScript objects. By leveraging specific input patterns involving nested property references such as "__proto__" and "toString", an adversary may trigger unintended modifications to Object.prototype, leading to potential denial-of-service conditions or runtime instability. This issue stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied property paths before their use in object manipulation operations, exposing applications to prototype pollution attacks without requiring direct user interaction beyond standard schema processing workflows. The vulnerability remains unaddressed in the latest available version.

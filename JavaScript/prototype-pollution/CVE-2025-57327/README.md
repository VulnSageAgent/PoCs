# CVE-2025-57327

## Type
CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')

## Description
A vulnerability exists in the spmrc package version 1.2.0 due to improper handling of property assignments in the `.set()` method, leading to prototype chain pollution. The issue arises when the method processes user-provided input containing nested property paths (e.g., `__proto__.pollutedProp`), allowing attackers to inject arbitrary properties into the prototype of built-in JavaScript objects. This can result in unintended modification of object behaviors, potentially enabling denial-of-service conditions or arbitrary code execution in contexts that rely on unmodified prototype chains. The vulnerability affects all applications using spmrc@1.2.0 or earlier, as no official patch or mitigation has been released to address the flaw.

# CVE-2025-57326

## Type
CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')

## Description
A vulnerability exists in the SassDoc Extras package (versions prior to 3.0.0) due to improper handling of user-provided input in the `byGroupAndType` function. When processing structured data, the function fails to adequately validate or sanitize input parameters, allowing attackers to manipulate internal data structures in a way that can pollute the JavaScript Object prototype. This issue enables unauthorized modification of the prototype chain, potentially leading to denial of service, data integrity compromises, or arbitrary code execution in contexts relying on unmodified prototype behavior. The vulnerability remains unpatched, and no official resolution is currently available.

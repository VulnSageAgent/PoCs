# CVE-2025-57325

## Type
CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')

## Description
The Rollbar package (version 2.26.4) is affected by an object prototype pollution vulnerability in its utility module. The software fails to properly sanitize deeply nested property paths during object manipulation operations, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary properties into the Object prototype chain. This vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating specific input vectors, leading to unintended modification of foundational object behaviors. Successful exploitation may result in application crashes, unexpected code execution paths, or bypass of security controls dependent on prototype integrity. The affected component remains unpatched at the time of disclosure.

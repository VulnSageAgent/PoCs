# CVE-2025-57318

## Type
CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')

## Description
A vulnerability exists in the csvjson package versions prior to 5.1.0, a Node.js library designed for CSV and JSON format conversion, due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the `addDataInSchema` function. This flaw allows attackers to manipulate the prototype chain of JavaScript objects via crafted input, leading to prototype pollution. By exploiting this issue, an adversary could inject arbitrary properties into the `Object.prototype`, potentially enabling denial-of-service conditions or unauthorized code execution in contexts where the modified prototype is subsequently accessed. The vulnerability remains unaddressed in the latest available version (5.1.0) and impacts applications relying on untrusted input processing through this library.

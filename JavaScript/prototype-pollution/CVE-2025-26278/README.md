# CVE-2025-26278

## Type
CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')

## Description
The dref package before version 0.1.2 contains a vulnerability in its handling of deep object reference operations. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted input that triggers improper processing of object property paths, leading to unintended modification of object prototypes. This prototype pollution issue allows an attacker to inject arbitrary properties into existing object prototypes, potentially causing denial-of-service conditions or enabling further exploitation through unexpected application behavior. The vulnerability exists in the package's `set` function when processing deeply nested property paths, and no official fix has been released to address this issue at the time of reporting.

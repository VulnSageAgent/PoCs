# CVE-2025-57321

## Type
CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')

## Description
The Node.js package **magix-combine-ex** (versions prior to and including 1.2.10) contains a prototype pollution vulnerability in the `magix-combine-ex/plugins/util-deps` module, stemming from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `addFileDepend` method. By manipulating the `riskyName` parameter to specify a malicious key (e.g., `__proto__`), an attacker can inject properties into the prototype chain of objects processed by the module. This flaw allows adversaries to alter the behavior of the application or underlying dependencies, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or data integrity compromise. The vulnerability affects versions 1.2.10 and likely persists in the latest available release (2.2.2) as no official remediation has been documented.

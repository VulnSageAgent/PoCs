# CVE-2025-57319

## Type
CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')

## Description
A vulnerability exists in the fast-redact package (version 3.5.0) due to improper restriction of prototype modification within the `nestedRestore` function of its modifiers module. The issue stems from insufficient validation of user-provided instructions during object redaction operations, allowing attackers to manipulate the prototype chain of built-in JavaScript objects. By supplying specially crafted input containing deeply nested paths targeting `Object.prototype`, an adversary can inject arbitrary properties into the prototype of base objects. This flaw enables unauthorized modification of fundamental object behaviors, potentially leading to denial of service conditions, data integrity compromises, or cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in applications relying on the library for sensitive data sanitization tasks. The vulnerability remains unpatched in the latest available version.

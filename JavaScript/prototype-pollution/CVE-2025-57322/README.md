# CVE-2025-57322

## Type
CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')

## Description
A vulnerability exists in the 'midway' Node.js package version 1.0.0, where improper handling of property path assignments in utility functions allows attackers to manipulate object prototype chains. This issue arises from insufficient validation of user-supplied property paths during nested object property operations, enabling unintended modification of Object.prototype properties. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or bypassing security checks in applications utilizing this framework. The vulnerability remains unaddressed in the latest available version, exposing applications that rely on the affected functionality to potential prototype pollution attacks. This weakness affects the integrity and availability of systems using vulnerable Midway framework implementations.

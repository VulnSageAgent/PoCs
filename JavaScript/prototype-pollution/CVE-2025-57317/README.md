# CVE-2025-57317

## Type
CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')

## Description
A vulnerability exists in the apidoc-core package version 0.15.0, a core parser library used to generate API documentation following the apidoc-spec. The software improperly restricts modification of object prototypes during the processing of nested data structures in API documentation files. Specifically, when parsing malformed input containing specially crafted "define" properties, the application may inadvertently assign properties to the prototype of base JavaScript objects. This issue arises due to insufficient validation of user-provided data before merging it into internal structures, allowing attackers to manipulate object inheritance chains. Successful exploitation could lead to denial of service conditions or unintended behavior in applications relying on the integrity of prototype chains. The vulnerability affects the preProcess function in the "apidoc-core/lib/workers/api_body_title" module. (Reference: https://github.com/apidoc/apidoc-core)

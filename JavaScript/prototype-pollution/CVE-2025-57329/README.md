# CVE-2025-57329

## Type
CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')

## Description
The Node.js package `web3-core-method` prior to version 1.10.4 is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to improper handling of constructor arguments in its method initialization process. This vulnerability arises when user-provided input is not adequately sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious keys (e.g., `__proto__`) into the prototype chain of JavaScript objects. Successful exploitation could lead to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or unintended behavior in applications utilizing the package. The issue specifically impacts the internal logic of the `web3-core-method` module, which is used to create methods within the web3.js ecosystem. No official fix or mitigation has been published at the time of this disclosure.

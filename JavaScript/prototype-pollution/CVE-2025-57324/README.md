# CVE-2025-57324

## Type
CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')

## Description
The Parse JavaScript SDK version 5.3.0 contains a prototype pollution vulnerability in the SingleInstanceStateController component of the browser module. Improper handling of user-provided class names during state initialization allows attackers to manipulate the prototype of JavaScript objects by specifying a className value of '__proto__'. This vulnerability enables the injection of arbitrary properties into the Object.prototype, potentially leading to denial of service conditions, unexpected application behavior, or bypass of security mechanisms due to the globally polluted prototype. The issue persists in the latest available version of the software at the time of disclosure.

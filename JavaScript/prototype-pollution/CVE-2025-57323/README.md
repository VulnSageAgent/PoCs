# CVE-2025-57323

## Type
CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')

## Description
A vulnerability exists in the mpreregular package versions 0.2.0 and below, allowing attackers to manipulate object prototypes through improper handling of event handler registrations. The issue arises when user-controlled input is used to specify event identifiers containing prototype chain modifications (e.g., "__proto__.pollutedProperty"), enabling insertion of arbitrary properties into the Object prototype. This prototype pollution vulnerability can lead to denial of service conditions or unexpected application behavior when polluted properties are accessed during runtime. The affected functionality is exposed through the addEventHandler method in the mp module, which fails to sanitize maliciously crafted event identifier strings before processing. No official fix or mitigation guidance has been published for this vulnerability at the time of disclosure.
